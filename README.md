# Dog Breed Fine-Grained Image Identification & Classification
1. This was for Advanced Predictive Modeling Class Project.</br>
* **Team Members : Jui Gupta, Jess Lee, Clay Mason, Chelsea Matthews, and Cuiting Zhong**</br>
2. We built image classfication models using VGG16, MobileNet, and Inception V3</br>

# Dataset
Used famous open data source [Stanford Dog Breed Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)
